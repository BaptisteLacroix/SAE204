- The second step, concerns the feeding of the database with data collected from the website thanks to a python program and an online generator, the script of the python program and the sql file allowing the insertion of the data 

- Finally the third and last step concerns the realization of indicators, with visualization of the results (percentages, graphs, etc.), For the rendering, a script of the indicators is requested as well as a summary document exliding the indicators and the results obtained
